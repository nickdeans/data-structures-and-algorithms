# Array Binary Search
I created a function that takes in two parameters: a sorted array and a key search value. Using binary search I found the key search value and the outputted the index. If the key search value was not found the output was -1.

## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without using built-in methods, return the index of the array's element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach and Efficiency 
I took the approach of understanding what the challenge was asking me to do in simplistic terms. I whiteboarded to help understand the problem domain and drew out a visual of what I believed the code would be doing. I wrote out my algorithm after devloping an understanding of binary searches. I ultimately coded out my algorithm and devloped my tests to see if the output was correct or wrong.
