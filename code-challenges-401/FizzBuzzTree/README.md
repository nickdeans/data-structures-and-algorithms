# K-ary Trees
I conducted "FizzBuzz" on a k-ary tree while traversin to create a new tree.

## Challenge
- Code Challenge 18
- Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
    - If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
    - If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
    - If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
    - If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
- Return a new tree.

## Approach and Efficiency
- Big 0
- Time = O(n * 2h)
- Space = O(n * 2)

## API
- fizzBuzzTree()
