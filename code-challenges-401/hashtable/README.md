# Hashtables
I created a Hashtable that utilizes a linked list data structure. The Hashtable contains several methods that include add(), get(), contains(), and hash().

## Challenge
- Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

- add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Space = O(n)
Big O Time = O(n)

## API
- insert()
- hash()
- add()
- contains()
- get()
