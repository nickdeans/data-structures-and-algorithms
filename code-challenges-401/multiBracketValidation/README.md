# Multi-Bracket Validation


## Challenge
Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

Round Brackets : ()
Square Brackets : []
Curly Brackets : {}

## Approach and Efficiency 
I took the approach of completing the asked challenge with neccessary functions and methods. Big O space is O(1) and time is on O(n)
