# Zip Lists
I created a function called ZipLists that takes two lists as arguments and zips them together.


## Challenge
Write a function called zipLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach and Efficiency 
I took the approach of completing the asked challenge with neccessary functions and methods. Big O space is O(1) and time is on O(n)

## API 
- Traverse()
- Insert()
