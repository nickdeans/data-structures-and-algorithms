# FIFO Animal SHelter
In this code challenge I created a class called AnimalShelter which holds dogs and cats. I added a enqueue method that adds animals to the shelter and dequeues animals(cats and dogs).

## Challenge
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
Implement the following methods:
enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Approach and Efficiency 
O(1) and O(n) Big O space/time.
