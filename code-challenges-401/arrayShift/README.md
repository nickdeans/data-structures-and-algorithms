# Array Shift 
I created a function that takes in an array and value and given a new value returns an array with the value in the middle index.

## Challenge
The code challenge asked me to create a function called insertArrayShift which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any built-in methods I returned an array with the new value in the middle index.

## Approach and Efficiency 
I took the pproach of understanding what the challenge was asking me to do in simplistic terms. I then began to think of different JavaScript code I could utilize without using methods. I came to a conclusion that I would need to create an array, distinguish the middle index of the array, and loop over the array to then output a new array with a value in the middle index.
