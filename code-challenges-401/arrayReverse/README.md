# Reverse an Array 
In this code challenge I created an array and returned the array in reversed order.

## Challenge
The code challenge asked me to create a function which takes in an array as an argument. Without utilizing any built-in methods available to JavaScript, I was asked to return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach and Efficiency 
I took the pproach of understanding what the challenge was asking me to do in simplistic terms. I then began to think of different JavaScript code I could utilize without using methods.
