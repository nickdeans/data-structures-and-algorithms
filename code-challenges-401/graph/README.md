# Graphs
I created a graph the includes different methods to add new nodes to the graph, add a new edge bewteen nodes in a graph, get all nodes in a graph as a collection, get neighbors, andget total number of nodes in a graph. 

## Challenge
Implement your own graph that includes the method of AddNode(), AddEdge(), GetNodes(), GetNeighbors(), and Size().

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Space:
Big O Time: 

## API
- addNode()
- addEdge()
- getNodes()
- getNeighbors()
- size()
