# Singly Linked List 
I created a Node class that has properties for the value stored in Node and a pointer to the next Node.


## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
- Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
- Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.

## Approach and Efficiency 
I took the approach of completing the asked challenge with neccessary functions and methods. Big O space is O(1) and time is on O(n)

## API 
- Traverse()
- Insert()
- Include ()
- toStirng()
- Append()
- insertBefore()
- insertAfter()
